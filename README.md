Script that classifies two types of images (Cancerous or health leukocytes) through pytorch
When using script remember to specifiy the PATH of where your image dataset is located

Datasets I used:

Cancer Blood Cells img Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhiljethwa/blood-cancer-image-data (Imgs in .tiff files so you may need to convert to .jpeg like I did)

Health Blood Cells img Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unclesamulus/blood-cells-image-dataset

My computer was able to achieve a Validation Accuracy of 99.97%

If you want to tweak it or use as a base for your own image classification projects go for it :)
